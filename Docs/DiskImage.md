### üß∑ Mounting and Replacing the EFI Folder on a Bootable USB

After flashing the image to your USB, you need to replace the existing EFI folder with a custom one. However, Windows does not allow direct access to EFI partitions, as it considers them unsafe. To work around this limitation, follow these steps:

#### **üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å≤Û†Ä∂Û†ÄπÛ†Åø Mount the EFI Partition**
1. Download and install [MiniTool Partition Wizard](https://www.partitionwizard.com/download.html).
2. Launch the tool and locate your bootable USB drive.
3. Identify the **EFI partition** and right-click on it.
4. Select **"Change Drive Letter"**, assign a drive letter of your choice, and apply the changes.

#### **üíΩ Access the EFI Partition**
1. Download and open **Explorer++** as an administrator.
2. Navigate to the drive letter you assigned to the EFI partition.
3. Delete the existing **EFI** folder from the USB.

#### **üìÑ Copy the New EFI Folder**
1. Download the EFI folder from [your repository] and extract it.
2. Using **Explorer++**, copy the extracted **EFI** folder to the EFI partition on the USB.

#### **‚úÖ Final Step: Boot from USB**
Your USB is now ready with the new EFI configuration. You can proceed to boot your system using the modified USB.
